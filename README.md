## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

To run :
	For testing purposes, this portfolio directory can be loaded up
	to a site such as github.com, which will act as the web host.
	The steps to setup github as the webhost are provided in the
	following site page: https://pages.github.com/
	Once the portfolio has been uploaded to the github.io directory,
	follow the steps below.
	
	1. In a web browser, load index.html.
		eg. if github username is "jk" - http://jk.github.io/

	2. To order pizza's
			click on "Cam's Pizzeria link"
				- click on Menu to see available pizzas
				- click on Our Ingredients	to see ingredient list
				- click on Locations to get addresses to stores
				- click on Contact Us to reach us
				- click on Pick A Pizza to select a pizza and begin the order process
				- Use the slider to select pizza size - small, medium, large

Optimizations added:
	The original code was modified to replace the lethargic screen updates in the
	following ways:
	
	1.  Processing time
		a.	Problem - Using the scroll bar causes slow screen updates
			Solution - Added mods to preload all images into an array and reuse as needed
			           thru the life of the program.  This dramatically reduces the time
			           cost of repeatedly using document.querySelectorAll() to create an
			           array of pizza images to be displayed on screen.

			           Additional mods were made to UpdatePositions() to fine tune the
			           time spent within the main loop in the function.

		b.	Problem - Using the pizza slider to select different pizza size causes heavy
			          processing time.
			Solution - Modified changePizzaSizes() to fine tune time spent in
					   main loop of function. Also using preloaded array of pizza images
					   in lieu of call to document.querySelectorAll().


	2.	Load time
			Problem - PageSpeedInsights identified 2 primary causes of load time delay -
					  very large images, and java scripts waiting for processing.
			Solution - Images were made smaller and compressed. Java script files were
					   inlined and external calls to java script files were given an
					   async tag to allow parallel processing of possible js files.

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
